// Write code to create a function that returns the factorial of `num`

//define variable for factorial
//write function that takes in arg of num
//loop DOWN from/through given num. (if "4", then should loop down from 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which will result in 24.)
//return result after loop completed, integers totalled in result variable.
